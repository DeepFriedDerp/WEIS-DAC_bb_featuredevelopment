*WEIS Design Variables*

Substructure:
x Member Draft
x Member freeboard
x Member length
x Column spacing
x Member diameter
x Member thickness
x Ballast volume per member
x Fairlead radius
x Fairlead depth
Number of offset columns: DISCRETE
Main column yes/no? (turbine on an offset column): DISCRETE

Mooring:
x Mooring line diameter
x Mooring line length
x Anchor radius
Material selection for lines / members: DISCRETE
Number of mooring lines: DISCRETE

Stiffener:
x Web height (using scalar multiplier on initial size)
x Web thickness (using scalar multiplier on initial size)
x Flange width (using scalar multiplier on initial size)
x Flange thickness (using scalar multiplier on initial size)
x Spacing

*WEIS Controls Design Variables*
Most ontology variables will be DVs
Maybe some aggregation for user-defined filters

TODO:
Define these in yaml
Enable copy / replica
Enable coordinate dependency

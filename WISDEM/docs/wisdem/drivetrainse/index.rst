DrivetrainSE
============

.. only:: html

    DrivetrainSE is a set of models to compute mass, loads, and performance of wind turbine components from the hub system, drivetrain gearbox, generator, and overall nacelle.  It replaces the older DriveSE, HubSE, and GeneratorSE modules which were not well integrated with the rest of WISDEM and difficult to maintain. The new code also supports direct drive configurations, which are becoming more prevalent for large offshore turbines.  They are also posed in a manner that is more consistent with the other WISDEM modules, where optimization problems are used to find design solutions that satisfy a set of constraints.

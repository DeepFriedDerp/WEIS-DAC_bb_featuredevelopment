MoorPy
======

MoorPy is a design-oriented mooring system library for Python based around a quasi-static modeling approach.  It is in the early stages of development and does not yet have a documentation available online.  It's capabilities and approach are similar to the `pyMAP <https://github.com/WISDEM/pyMAP/>`_ module that was previously used in WISDEM, but is easier to install and extend with new features.  MoorPy is available as a standalone analysis tool from its home `GitHub repository <https://github.com/NREL/MoorPy/>`_.

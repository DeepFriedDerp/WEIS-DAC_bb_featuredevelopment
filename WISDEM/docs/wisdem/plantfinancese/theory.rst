Theory
------

The theory for the models in this software are based directly on the work described in the reference for the NREL Cost and Scaling Model :cite:`Fingersh2006`
and in the more recent work from Mowers and Mai, 2021 :cite`MOWERS2021106931`.
The NREL Cost and Scaling Model provides a simple cost and sizing tool to estimate wind plant cost of energy based on a small number of input parameters such as rotor diameter, hub height and rated power.
The models here extract the financial calculators from the model as stand-alone modules.

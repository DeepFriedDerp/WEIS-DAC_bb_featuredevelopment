Examples
---------
All of these case studies below can be found in the `examples` directory.  For the ones that exercise just a single WISDEM module, it is easiest (for now) to call them directly from a Python script, with code examples provided through the module-specific documentation.  For the case studies that exercise multiple modules together, they are described in-depth in the links below.
